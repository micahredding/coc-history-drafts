# ---------- THE HOOK ----------
A(Q('&ldquo;The Presbytery of Springfield, sitting at Cane Ridge&hellip; being, through a gracious Providence, <b>in more than ordinary bodily health, growing in strength and size daily</b>, and in perfect soundness and composure of mind; but knowing that it is appointed for all delegated bodies once to die&hellip; do make and ordain this our Last Will and Testament&hellip;&rdquo;', WILL, 'June 28, 1804') +
  N('The will&rsquo;s opening, in the legal form of a real will. Read it slowly; the joke is in &ldquo;more than ordinary bodily health.&rdquo; Nobody makes a will because they are growing in strength and size daily.',
    '&rarr; This church body was nine months old, and thriving. Why would it write its own will?'))

  '<aside class=notes>Ask it and take one or two guesses. Don&rsquo;t answer. &rarr; &ldquo;To find out, go back nine months, to a garden in Lexington.&rdquo;</aside></section>')

# ---------- 1 THE GARDEN ----------
A(C('The Garden', 'September 1803. The Synod of Kentucky meets at Lexington.', 'Lexington &middot; September 1803'))

A('<section class="slide"><div class=eyebrow>The Synod of Kentucky</div>'

  '<div class="sub frag">Four other ministers are watching.<br>They preach what he preaches.</div>'
  '<aside class=notes>McNemar&rsquo;s own presbytery in Ohio (the Washington Presbytery) had already put him through &ldquo;their fiery ordeal,&rdquo; in Stone&rsquo;s phrase, for preaching what the revival preached: the gospel is for everyone, and anyone may respond to it. That is not what the Westminster Confession says, and every Presbyterian minister had sworn to the Confession. His case came up to the Synod at Lexington. The four watching: Robert Marshall, John Dunlavy, John Thompson, and Barton Stone, the minister of Cane Ridge. Same machinery as Chapter 2, four years earlier and on the other side of the mountains.</aside></section>')

  '<p class="bigquote long" style="margin-top:2vmin"><span class=q>&ldquo;It was plainly hinted to us, that <b>we would not be forgotten</b> by the Synod.&rdquo;</span></p>'
  '<aside class=notes>Stone, who the room met at Cane Ridge in Chapter 1. &ldquo;We waited anxiously for the issue, till we plainly saw it would be adverse to him, and consequently to us all.&rdquo;</aside></section>')

A(Q('&ldquo;In a short recess of Synod, we five withdrew to a private garden, where, after prayer for direction, and a free conversation, with a perfect unanimity we drew up a protest&hellip; and a declaration of our independence, and of our <b>withdrawal from their jurisdiction, but not from their communion</b>.&rdquo;', STONE, 'The garden') +
  N('The cold open of the whole story. Five men, a recess, a garden, prayer. &ldquo;A declaration of our independence&rdquo;: his words, twenty-seven years after the other one.'))

A(CARD('They left the court.<br>' + G('They did not leave the table.'),
  'The chapter in one line. The men about to put them out were still their brothers, and they would not put anyone out in return. &rarr; Compare Chapter 2: same machinery, different answer. Campbell was put out; these five walked out, and kept the communion.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;This protest we immediately presented to the Synod, through their Moderator &mdash; it was altogether unexpected by them, and produced very unpleasant feelings; and <b>a profound silence for a few minutes ensued</b>.&rdquo;', STONE) +
  N('Let the room have a few seconds of silence of its own.'))

A('<section class="slide"><div class=eyebrow>The Synod sends a committee to win them back</div>'
  '<div class=litany>'
  '<div class="no frag">One of the committee, Matthew Houston, &ldquo;became convinced that the doctrine we preached was true, and <b>soon after united with us</b>.&rdquo;</div>'
  '<div class="no frag">Another, &ldquo;old father David Rice,&rdquo; argued &ldquo;that every departure from Calvinism was an advance to atheism&rdquo;:</div>'
  '<div class="no frag" style="color:var(--gold)">Calvinism &rarr; Arminianism &rarr; Pelagianism &rarr; deism &rarr; atheism</div>'
  '</div><div class=cite>' + STONE + '</div>'
  '<aside class=notes>Three clicks, and a smile. The committee sent to bring them back lost a member to them. Rice was the father of Kentucky Presbyterianism and Stone honors him (&ldquo;of precious memory&rdquo;), but his argument, Stone says, &ldquo;could have no effect on minds ardent in the search of truth.&rdquo; Notice the logic: the creed is the only thing between you and atheism. Chapter 3 answered that.</aside></section>')

A(Q('&ldquo;We insisted that after we had orderly protested, and withdrawn, that the Synod had <b>no better right to suspend us, than the pope of Rome had to suspend Luther</b>, after he had done the same thing.&rdquo;', STONE, 'The suspension') +
  N('The Synod suspended them anyway and sent committees to read &ldquo;the Synod&rsquo;s bull of suspension&rdquo; in their pulpits and declare their churches vacant. Stone&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;bull,&rdquo; is the pope&rsquo;s word, on purpose. Luther again, from last week: Worms.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;not only were churches divided, but families; those who before had lived in harmony and love, were now set in hostile array against each other. What scenes of confusion and distress! <b>not produced by the Bible; but by human authoritative creeds</b>&hellip;&rdquo;', STONE) +
  N('The cost to the people. The sentence goes on: &ldquo;My heart was sickened, and effectually turned against such creeds, as nuisances of religious society, and the very bane of Christian unity.&rdquo;',
    '&rarr; Then the cost to Stone.'))

# ---------- 2 THE COST ----------
A(C('The Cost', 'Stone and his two congregations, Cane Ridge and Concord.', 'Cane Ridge &middot; late 1803'))

A(Q('&ldquo;I called together my congregations, and informed them that I could no longer conscientiously preach to support the Presbyterian church&hellip; that I absolved them from all obligations in a pecuniary point of view, and then <b>in their presence tore up their salary obligation to me</b>&hellip;&rdquo;', STONE) +
  N('Mime it if you like. He kept preaching to them, &ldquo;but not in the relation that had previously existed between us.&rdquo; Of the people: &ldquo;Never have I found a more loving, kind, and orderly people in any country.&rdquo; Of the day: &ldquo;This was truly a day of sorrow, and the impressions of it are indelible.&rdquo;'))

A(Q('&ldquo;I preferred honesty and a good conscience to all these things. Having now no support from the congregations, and having emancipated my slaves, I turned my attention cheerfully, though awkwardly, to labor on my little farm&hellip; often on my return home, <b>I found the weeds were getting ahead of my corn</b>.&rdquo;', STONE) +
  N('He had already freed the people he had enslaved; elsewhere: &ldquo;choosing poverty with a good conscience, in preference to all the treasures of the world.&rdquo; Now no salary either. He preached almost every night and worked the field at night &ldquo;while others were asleep.&rdquo;',
    '&rarr; And here is the surprise: it worked.'))

# ---------- 3 IT WORKED, AND THE PROBLEM ----------
A('<section class="slide"><h2>It worked.</h2>'
  '<div class=litany>'
  '<div class="no frag">They form the <b>Springfield Presbytery</b> and publish the <i>Apology</i>: no authoritative creed but the Bible.</div>'
  '<div class="no frag">The pamphlets against them, &ldquo;full of misrepresentation and invective,&rdquo; <b>spread their views</b>.</div>'
  '<div class="no frag">People &ldquo;disgusted and offended&rdquo; by the attacks &ldquo;were driven from them, and <b>cleaved to us</b>.&rdquo;</div>'
  '</div><div class=cite>' + STONE + '</div>'
  '<aside class=notes>Three clicks. The Methodists in Virginia reprinted the <i>Apology</i>, &ldquo;except our remarks upon creeds.&rdquo; Churches planted, preachers multiplied.<br>&rarr; Which is exactly when the problem began.</aside></section>')

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;they endeavored to cultivate a spirit of love and unity with all Christians; but found it extremely difficult to suppress the idea that they themselves were a party separate from others. <b>This difficulty increased in proportion to their success.</b>&rdquo;', WIT, 'Why they did it') +
  N('The witnesses who signed the will, explaining it. They left a party because it fenced Christians apart. Now people saw them as a party, and they began to feel like one. Stone, the same year: &ldquo;we had not worn our name more than one year, before we saw it savored of a party spirit.&rdquo;'))

A(CARD('Success was making them<br>' + G('the thing they had protested.'),
  'Say it once. Failure would have been easy to read; success was the danger.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;We will, that our weak brethren, who may have been <b>wishing to make the Presbytery of Springfield their king</b>, and wot not what is now become of it, betake themselves to the Rock of Ages, and follow Jesus for the future.&rdquo;', WILL, 'From the will') +
  N('Their own people. Gentle, and a little funny: &ldquo;wot not what is now become of it.&rdquo; The presbytery was being asked to stand where Christ stands.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;they soon found that there was <b>neither precept nor example in the New Testament for such confederacies</b> as modern Church Sessions, Presbyteries, Synods, General Assemblies, etc.&rdquo;', WIT, 'Writing a book on church government',
     sub='<div class="sub frag">Their own presbytery was one of them.</div>') +
  N('At their last meeting they set out to write <i>Observations on Church Government</i>. The research convicted the researchers: &ldquo;while they continued in the connection in which they then stood, they were off the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.&rdquo; (The book never appeared.)'))

A(CARD('They caught their own presbytery<br>' + G('being handed a job only Christ can do.'),
  'Last week&rsquo;s thesis, lived five years before it was written: anything asked to do a job only Christ can do will fail. They did not wait for it to fail. &rarr; So they let it die.'))

  '<aside class=notes>Back to the room of Chapter 1. Three years earlier, thousands came through the mud to an open table here. The will is dated &ldquo;sitting at Cane Ridge,&rdquo; by tradition in this meetinghouse. Signed by six: the five from the garden and David Purviance.</aside></section>')

A(Q('&ldquo;For where a testament is, there must of necessity be <b>the death of the testator</b>&hellip; Verily, verily I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but <b>if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit</b>.&rdquo;', 'The will&rsquo;s epigraph &middot; Hebrews 9:16; John 12:24', 'At the top of the page') +
  N('They put the theology at the top. A will has no force while the testator lives. The inheritance can only pass when the presbytery is gone.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;Imprimis. We will, that this body <b>die, be dissolved, and sink into union with the Body of Christ at large</b>; for there is but one body, and one spirit, even as we are called in one hope of our calling.&rdquo;', WILL, 'First bequest') +
  N('&ldquo;Imprimis&rdquo;: in the first place, the legal word. Ephesians 4:4. The presbytery does not dissolve into nothing; it sinks into the whole church. The heir is the Body of Christ at large.'))

  '<aside class=notes>Three clicks. A will gives things away; this one gives away everything a church body has: its name, its titles, its legislative power. Not abolished: bequeathed.

A(Q('&ldquo;We will, that each particular church, as a body&hellip; <b>choose her own preacher</b>, and support him by a free will offering&hellip; admit members &mdash; remove offences; and <b>never henceforth delegate her right of government to any man or set of men whatever</b>.&rdquo;', WILL, 'To every congregation') +
  N('The biggest bequest. Everything the Synod did to them (try preachers, admit, exclude) is handed to the congregation. Also: the church will &ldquo;try her candidates for the ministry&hellip; and admit no other proof of their authority, but Christ speaking in them.&rdquo; The priesthood of all believers, as polity.',
    '&rarr; Hold this one. In two weeks, at Brush Run, a congregation will use exactly this right.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;We will, that preachers and people, cultivate a spirit of mutual forbearance; <b>pray more and dispute less</b>; and while they behold the signs of the times, look up, and confidently expect that redemption draweth nigh.&rdquo;', WILL, 'To preachers and people') +
  N('A church that has given away its courts has nothing left to settle its quarrels but forbearance and prayer, and the will says so. Then the eschatology of the whole class in one clause: look up; redemption draweth nigh. They died expecting the future.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;from its first existence it was knit together in love, lived in peace and concord, and <b>died a voluntary and happy death</b>.&rdquo;', WIT, 'The witnesses') +
  N('Not a split, not a failure, not a scandal. A happy death.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;from a principle of love to Christians of every name, the precious cause of Jesus, and <b>dying sinners who are kept from the Lord by the existence of sects and parties</b> in the church, they have cheerfully consented to retire from the din and fury of conflicting parties &mdash; sink out of the view of fleshly minds, and die the death.&rdquo;', WIT, 'Why') +
  N('The three reasons: love of Christians of every name; the cause of Jesus; and the people outside, kept from the Lord by our divisions. That third one is the Evils of Division from last week.'))

A(Q('&ldquo;&hellip;we became a by-word and laughing stock to the sects around; all prophesying our speedy annihilation. Yet <b>from this period I date the commencement of that reformation</b>, which has progressed to this day.&rdquo;', STONE) +
  N('They threw the party name overboard with the creeds and took the name Christian (Rice Haggard&rsquo;s pamphlet). Stone does not date the movement from Cane Ridge in 1801, or from the garden in 1803. He dates it from here: the giving up of the party.'))
